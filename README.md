## About
This repository is both a **portfolio** of my solutions and a **learning resource** for others interested in AI problem-solving in Olympiad-style competitions.

All problems solved, scored the maximum (100 points) or as much as I could get.

## How to Use

1. Clone into a problem folder.  
2. Run `main.py` (or open in google collab).  
3. The script will read `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv`, train a model, and generate predictions.  
4. Predictions will be saved into `submission.csv`, overwriting the existing file.
